## This file will be for keeping track of potential backup plans and data should the current project not work
The necessity for this file became apparent when our team discovered that high quality hourly data from specific weather stations are often not publicly available because the data is quite valuable, and there is a scarcity of free resources for this. While we did create a backup plan for this (Great Salt Lake Dust) project idea, it would also likely involve weather data.

This file is for linking datasets we can already access and stating potential associated project ideas

1) use cbg (census block group) as a join key for multiple different datasets could make some sort of map application with it
