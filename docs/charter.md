## Business Question
How can Snowbasin Resort predict peak-hour traffic volume on Trappers Loop (SR-167) 72 hours in advance so operations managers can proactively staff, activate overflow parking, and communicate arrival guidance to guests?

## Stakeholder
Primary stakeholder: Snowbasin Resort operations managers who coordinate staffing, parking, and guest communications. Secondary stakeholder: resort leadership responsible for guest experience and operational risk.

## Success Metrics
**Technical**
- Regression: achieve ≤ 15% MAPE (or RMSE improvement over a naïve baseline) for predicted peak-hour volume (7:00–9:00 AM).
- Classification (optional): ≥ 90% precision/recall for “High Congestion” days.

**Business**
- Reduce peak-day parking overflow incidents and on-road queue time by at least 10% compared with prior seasons.
- Improve staffing accuracy for peak days (e.g., reduce last-minute staffing adjustments by 20%).

## Defined Roles
- **Dani Lopez** — Data Engineer (data sourcing, ingestion, cleaning).
- **Hazem Dawahi** — Modeling Lead (feature engineering, model selection, evaluation).
- **Roberto Camposeco** — Git/Project Manager (repo hygiene, issues, milestones, documentation).
- **Kevin Bell** — Research Lead (domain research, stakeholder requirements, data validation).

These roles are just made up. Feel free to change them at any time.
